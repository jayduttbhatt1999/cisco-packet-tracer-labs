# Cisco Packet Tracer Labs 🚀

Welcome to my curated collection of Cisco Packet Tracer labs, developed as part of my hands-on learning journey while preparing for the **CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)** certification. This repository showcases my practical understanding of core networking concepts through simulated environments using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Each lab folder contains:
- ✅ A **.pkt file** ready to be opened in Cisco Packet Tracer
- 📘 A **README.md** file explaining the topology, configurations, and learning outcomes
