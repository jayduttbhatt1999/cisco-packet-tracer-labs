# Cisco Packet Tracer Labs 🚀

Welcome to my curated collection of Cisco Packet Tracer labs, developed as part of my hands-on learning journey while preparing for the **CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)** certification. This repository showcases my practical understanding of core networking concepts through simulated environments using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Each lab folder contains:
- ✅ A **.pkt file** ready to be opened in Cisco Packet Tracer
- 📘 A **README.md** file explaining the topology, configurations, and learning outcomes

## 📂 Lab Categories

| Lab Title                       | Key Topics Covered                                 |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| [OSPF Routing](./OSPF-Routing) | Multi-area OSPF, neighbor adjacency, route tables |



## 🧠 What You’ll Find

- 🔧 Real-world inspired **topologies** simulating enterprise networks
- 🧾 **Step-by-step configurations** of routers, switches, and PCs
- 🧪 **Troubleshooting and verification** commands (`show ip route`, `ping`, `traceroute`, etc.)
- 🎓 Labs aligned with **CCNA exam objectives**
